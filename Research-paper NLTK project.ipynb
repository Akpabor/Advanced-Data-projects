Foucauldian Discourse Analysis goes against the westernized concept of structures such \\nas gender, sexuality morality and norm, as it disregards the notion that these conce pts are immutable \\nand mainly biological, and suggests that society is fluid, placing the wider sociocultural and historical \\ncontext of a society as the basic foundations of creating discourses, placing individual concepts and \\ngroups in hierarchies, with kn owledge and power granting access to higher places in the societal \\nhierarchy and therefore facilitating the production of discourses. In light of that, the introduction \\nincludes three qualitative studies that depict the fluidity of gender concepts regardin g domestic abuse, \\nand analyzing in the analysis section the power dynamics, subject positions and discourses created \\nregarding the two actors, based on theoretical background around FDA analysis and social \\nconstructionism, qualitative studies, as well as r ecordings of the live trial in 2022 and two articles out \\nof the four that were chosen, analyzing themes of gender differences, court environment and the media. \\nThe use of 6 analytic tools were used in order to identify the discourses, as well as explain th e social \\nconstructionist perspective around gender and language.  \\n \\nKeywords: Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, FDA, Gender, Discourse, Social constructionism  \\n \\nINTRODUCTION  \\nThe Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case has been a widely observed and discussed topic both \\nin the media and across popular culture. This case involves two high -profiled actors, in which \\nthere exists a complex power dynamic, involving allegations of domestic violence from both \\nof the parties, which includes claims of both physical and psychological abuse. The former \\ncouple, which has been divorced since 2017, attended their first trial over the abuse claims in \\n2020 in UK, in which Johnny Depp initiated a defam ation lawsuit against Amber Heard, \\nclaiming that she falsely accused the actor for domestic abuse, and more specifically, the actor \\nwas against a major UK news outlet “THE SUN”, in which the author of THE SUN described \\nthe actor as a “WIFE BEATER” and desc ribed how Johnny Depp was abusive towards his ex -\\nwife, when the charges against him at that time were only speculative (Christodoulou & \\nPollard, 2021 ).  \\nThe actor lost his case against the UK news outlet “THE SUN”, and from then Johnny Depp \\ncontinued to go against his ex -wife, Amber, to whom another defamation lawsuit was \\nperformed in early 2022, which involved both actors, in a high-profile  case, claiming the Markel Marishta  et.al. Johnny Depp and amber heard: how language and societal influences shape power and \\ndiscourses  \\n \\n                                      International Journal of Research and Review (ijrrjournal.com)   134 \\nVolume 11; Issue: 2; February 2024  domestic abuse claims over one another. The trial had a duration of roughly 3 months, starting \\nfrom April 11th and ending on the first of June, in which between these three months, both \\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard, not only described their personal experiences regarding the \\npre-existing abusive allegations, but also moved against one another in an effort to both \\ndiscredit the other party, and accuse them of being the aggressor, whilst they themselves were \\nthe victims. While the resulting verdict pointed towards Johnny Depp, the aim of this study \\nfocuses on the multiple discourses that took place both during the tri al, and outside of it, while \\nalso observing and analyzing the shifts of power that was present regarding both actors, in \\ndifferent ways.  \\nThe present report is based on Michel Foucault’s theoretical basis of Discourse analysis, which \\nwill be used in the report’s analysis chapter, and also the foundations of the analysis are also \\nbased on a social constructionism point of view, which will be discussed below.  \\nTo begin with, qualitative research aims to analyze how individuals understand, experience \\nand interpret the world around them, through a meaning -making process and not by analyzing \\npre-existing and fixed social realities, thus not aiming to generalize res ults into the mean \\npopulation, but differentiate and gain data or results based on individuals’ unique experiences \\n(Bhatasara et al., 2013; Erslingsson & Brysiewicz, 2013). Considering that people are social \\nbeings, they experience themselves through the m ediation of symbolisms, culture and \\nlanguage, forming a complexity of human experiences, thus making qualitative analysis a great \\ntool of interpreting these experiences through data analysis (Nowell et al., 2017).  \\nSocial constructionism, which can be directly connected with the ideology behind qualitative \\nanalysis, originates from sociology and argues the nature of knowledge and truths as being \\nsocially created and not discovered by the individual’s mind, rather it corresponds with a \\ncollective society’s cultural and historical influences, that makes concepts such as gender, class \\nand sexuality more fluid than what was firstly believed to be strongly only biological and \\nimmutable (Young & Colin, 2004). Additionally, social constructionism is directly embedded \\nwith critical psychology, as it goes against the mainstream psychology ideology of objective \\ntruths, marking it as a westernized concept, where biological and developmental processes in \\nregard to gender and socie ty are not the key factors that predict or directly influence \\nbehavior/knowledge (Burr & Dick, 2017).  \\nStructuralism is a term that heavily influenced the sociologist and philosopher Michel Foucault, \\nin its’ views on how language and culture, operate within a society’s rules and structures around \\nlaws, principles and individual’s behaviors (Khan & MacEachen, 2021) . Additionally, \\nstructuralism assesses how language and culture have a relative relation and operate as the \\nterms subject and object, specifically suggesting that there exists a center, in which it operates \\nand sustains a whole structure (Khan & MacEachen, 2021) . Regarding these claims, every \\nsystem such as language, culture, sexuality and gender operate under a structure that consists \\nof laws, rules and determining factors that conform systems such as gender and sexuality \\n(Khan, 2018 (as mentioned in Khan & MacEachen, 2021)).  \\nPost-structuralism, contrasts from the initial views of structuralism and focuses in the \\ninteraction between the stimuli and the receiver (Khan & MacEachen, 2021) . It uses a \\nsymbolism regarding a reader and a text, in which the text is not passive, but active in the \\nprocess and production of meaning, and suggests that a text, which can be replaced with the \\nterm language, is able to create different interpretations to different readers, depending on each \\nindividual’s unique life experiences (Han, 2013). This suggests the notion that objective reality \\nor objective truth does not exist, rather it depends on the “reader’s” perception of the world, \\ncreating accepted trut hs, or as Foucault reframed it as discourses (Khan & MacEachen, 2021) . \\nDiscourses, as Foucault later developed, was referring to “unwritten” rules, regulations cultural \\nand structural (as mentioned before) values, that produce and maintain certain behaviors or \\nsubjective truths, which referring to the work of Foucault mainly involved gender norms and Markel Marishta  et.al. Johnny Depp and amber heard: how language and societal influences shape power and \\ndiscourses  \\n \\n                                      International Journal of Research and Review (ijrrjournal.com)   135 \\nVolume 11; Issue: 2; February 2024  sexuality, whereas it can also incorporate individualized statements as a whole in order to create  \\ngroups within a societal context, such as heterosexuality, homosexuality, disability etc. \\n(Foucault, 1972, as mentioned in  Khan & MacEachen, 2021) . Thus, a discourse is an accepted \\ntruth, that is created by sociopolitical influences, and exists within a specific place and time, \\nhinting that such structures are fluid, and dependent on the context of time, place and culture.  \\nFoucault focused a lot on power and knowledge as well, with the tool of language, that can \\ncreate or alter power in regard to either discourses, or subject positions (Foucault, 1981). \\nFoucault believed that knowledge is shaped by power, and that in every s ociety, there exists a \\nhierarchy in which different individuals, or subject positions, had “access” to more power \\ndomes (Foucault, 1981). Power can refer to a number of things, it can refer to either a teacher \\nin contrast to its’ students, therefore reveal ing the subject position’s power over others, within \\nthe social context that is a school, or it can refer to a greater and more complex form of power \\nsuch gender, and how discourses that revolve around the genders, can affect the power that \\nthey obtain. Fo r instance, through historical data, the interaction and difference of the female \\ngender and male gender as to their role in a society can be easily observed. Before the feminism \\nmovement took place, the female role was dependent more on biological and dev elopmental \\ndiscourses, meaning that due to the female gender’s disadvantage in areas such as physical \\nstrength, and the prehistoric data that men were the hunters and women were the nurturers, it \\nwas accepted within that time’s context that a woman should stay home and take care of the \\nfamily, whereas the man should work and provide for the woman, and also from the \\ndevelopmental discourse, that men are more aggressive and violent whereas women are more \\nkind and caring (Hollway, 1984). These concepts of soci ety and structures were the building \\nblocks for Foucault’s discourse analysis.  \\nIn Johnny Depp’s and Amber Heard’s case, considering the previous theoretical background, \\nmany major discourses can take place, especially referring to the domestic abuse accusations. \\nWhile the Analysis chapter of this essay will cover and analyze the fram ework of the former \\ncouple’s relationship and court behavior, it is important to refer to some current ideological \\ntendencies that societies have constructed regarding gender differences and their views on \\nviolence. Qualitative research  which analyzed gender norms and intimate partner relationships \\namongst 33 Columbian women, revealed that more often than not, the couples often held \\npatriarchal norms, which can describe a connection between domestic violence against women \\nand patriarchy,  since in the research mentioned, a facilitator of these aggressive behaviors \\nmainly originated from the underemployment of men and successful employment of women \\noutside the house context (Hynes et al., 2015 ).  \\nAnother qualitative study emphasizes on the work of social workers, and the double standard \\nthat exists within a couple, and more specifically in relationships that there exists a history of \\ndomestic abuse (Pitman, 2017). Referring to the study, as coerciv e control is a critical skill \\namongst social workers, in order to assess and recognize the situations needed, it is more often \\nthan not difficult to apply the double standard of men and women in regards to domestic abuse, \\nwith social workers leaning toward s the concept of a male perpetrator and a woman victim, \\nthus empowering the already existing developmental discourse of gender violence and control \\n(Pitman, 2017). The last study refers to the men who have been victims to domestic violence \\nfrom women in Ba ngladesh, stating that the predominant social actions in these cases involve \\nsilence and reservation from the media, and the constitutions, highlighting the victimhood \\ndiscourse which places women as a “likelihood” of being the victim, with the study sugge sting \\nactions such as “ breaking the social prejudice associated with that kind of violence, and create \\ngender -neutral legal interventions and laws to protect men at home from violence ” (Khan & \\nArendse, 2021) . Considering some of the evident discourses that have been constructed around \\ngender differences and domestic violence, the current study aims to analyze the Johnny Depp \\nand Amber Heard case, regarding both the court that took place in 2022 and the articl es that Markel Marishta  et.al. Johnny Depp and amber heard: how language and societal influences shape power and \\ndiscourses  \\n \\n                                      International Journal of Research and Review (ijrrjournal.com)   136 \\nVolume 11; Issue: 2; February 2024  have been written both during and afterwards. The aim of this study does not involve in \\nhighlighting why the case took place, but how language was used in order to construct \\ndiscourses, how power was obtained and how the role of the media and the social co ntext \\nhelped change or sustain the discourses in question. In contrast to quantitative studies, an FDA \\nanalysis does not aim to generalize the findings that are presented, as it regards both of the \\nparties as unique, as the time, the place, the culture and  the variable of Johnny Depp and Amber \\nHeard being celebrities, all fit in within a specific context that cannot be replicated.  \\n \\nMETHODOLOGY  \\nThe foundations around Foucauldian discourse analysis are based on the epistemology of social \\nconstructionism, which can be explained by observing some of the key factors that this \\nepistemology uses. Social constructionism refers to the nature of knowledge  as not being a \\ndirect reflection of an objective reality, rather that it is constructed through social processes, \\nbased on social interactions, cultural norms and historical contexts that maintain or change it \\n(Burr & Dick, 2017). Meaning making in a soci al constructionist view is not inherit in object \\nor events, rather it is assigned through language and communication. The words and language \\nused, are assigned to create discourses and convey knowledge, in which the meaning is socially \\nand culturally inter preted differently (Young & Collin, 2004). The epistemology bases its’ \\nviews on subjectivity rather than objectivity, reinforcing a notion of multiple perspectives in \\nunderstanding social phenomena. In cause of this notion, social context and power relatio ns \\nplay a major role in understanding how discourses are constructed and how knowledge is \\nconveyed, since social constructionism analyze how power structures often influence these \\nconstructions influence social categories such as identities, categories and  hierarchies within a \\nsocietal environment (Khan & MacEachen, 2021) . Thus, reflexivity and critical awareness is \\nencouraged in this analytical approach, to approach a construct considering the context, \\nhistorical notions and cultural behaviors, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the social \\nworld.  \\nConsidering the analytical approach of Foucauldian Discourse Analysis,  there are 6 analytical \\nsteps involving FDA analysis. Firstly, identifying the discourses and discursive constructions, \\nwhich are comprised by systems of ideas beliefs and practices that shape knowledge and power \\ndomes, then applying a historical analysis on the disc ourses, in order to understand and observe \\nhow the discourse might have been created, how it has evolved over time and its’ relationship \\nto broader sociopolitical and cultural dynamics (Willig, 2008). Action orientation, the third \\nanalytic step, refers to the ways that the discourses function in order to produce certain \\nbehaviors or beliefs. This happens with the power that language upholds, and aims to create \\nspecific subjectivities around a theme, regulating this behavior and shapes social practices. The \\nproduction of knowledge, how it is produced and circulated within the discourse and the \\nstrategies that are presented in how and what the considered “truths” are established. Subject \\nformation refers  to how individuals are positioned and are constituted  as subjects within the \\ndiscourse, including the ways in which identities, roles and social categories are produced and \\nmaintained. (Willig, 2008). The fifth step, which is practice, refers to the various ways \\ndiscourses are enacted, embodied and materiali zed in a wider social and institutional context. \\nPractice is not only bound to individualized acts and behaviors, but it is embedded within \\nsocial, cultural and historical context. These are influenced by the discourses and the power \\nrelations that operate  within a society, and contribute to the production and maintenance of \\nnorms, knowledge and subjectivity. Subjectivity, the final analytical step, refers to the way \\nindividuals within a society are placed as subjects within specific discourse and power \\nrelations, enabling the formation of identity, selfhood and the constant internalization of social \\nvalues, norms and “available” knowledge. Subjectivity is a major part that is affected by power \\nrelations, since discourses function in order to discipline and control individuals within it, Markel Marishta  et.al. Johnny Depp and amber heard: how language and societal influences shape power and \\ndiscourses  \\n \\n                                      International Journal of Research and Review (ijrrjournal.com)   137 \\nVolume 11; Issue: 2; February 2024  shaping their points of view, desires and behaviors as a whole. In the attempt of analyzing this \\nstep, the ways that discourses operate, how they regulate behavior and normalize certain forms \\nof subjectivity will be revealed and discussed (Willig, 2008).  \\nThe data that was used for the analysis refers to the 4 articles that were written about the 2020 \\nand 2022 domestic violence trial, in which 2 were used in the analysis, that involved the actors \\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard, and also the live video recordin g of the defamation lawsuit. \\nThe articles were collected from ProQuest via the digital library of the University of Derby, \\nand also from various independent articles that derived from Google, as well as YouTube, since \\nthe articles that were used in the ana lysis aimed to contain forms of subjectivity in the case and \\na descriptive factor around the life and actions both inside and outside the court environment \\nand also in order to analyze language directly emerging from the live trial, videos that contained \\nthese information was necessary. The databases were searched for articles containing the terms \\n“Johnny Depp”, “Amber Heard”, “trial”, published from April 2020 to February 2023. Articles \\nbelow 300 words were excluded. This form of data collection, mainly in cluding articles and \\nvideos compliment the use of Foucauldian discourse analysis, since the aim of the analysis is \\nto assess and analyze the use of language, the style of which the language is either written or \\nspoken, and observe how language constructs d iscourses, how it maintains and shifts power \\nrelation and the way that subject positions are formed, through a series of FDA analytical tools \\n(Willig, 2008). The study followed the guidelines of General Data Protection Regulations.  \\n \\nANALYSIS  \\nThis covers the themes that were derived from the 4 articles and video recording regarding the \\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard case. Specifically, this part of the analysis will be divided into \\nthree parts, considering the three different themes that are discu ssed, where each of the themes  \\ndescribes one or more discourses, the power relation between either societal values and the \\ndiscourse, or the subject positions within the discourses. The first theme refers to gender \\ndiscourses, how gender norms were  brought up and used before, during and after the court case, \\nand how these structures were either changed or empowered. The second refers to the court \\nenvironment. This theme is heavily focused on how truth and the multiple perspectives that \\nsurround it i s treated within a court environment. Language, power relations between the actors \\nand jury and “outside” structures such as media outlets are considered power domes and the \\ninterplay between them and the court are the main discussion point. The last one r efers to \\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard  being public figures, and how the accusations and the subject \\npositions of each of them influences and also are influenced by historical discourses, are \\nrepresented by already existing societal groups such as the MeToo movement, or even go \\nagainst them.  \\n \\nJohnny Depp vs Amber Heard, Man vs Woman  \\nThe first extract is from the widely popular UK article called “THE SUN”. It refers to a trial \\nthat was held in 2021 and refers to gender norms based on mainly evolutionary and historical \\ndiscourses based around men and the position that they uphold in a s ociety, with a use of \\nspecific language and terms that enhance its’ discursive power (Wi llig, 2008).  \\nExtract 1  \\n[headline] – OUT OF HIS DEPP Wife -beater Johnny Depp LOSES bid to appeal ruling after \\nThe Sun revealed he beat ex Amber Heard 12 times.  \\n1. A judge at the High Court ruled we were right to brand  Depp, 57, a \"wife beater\"  \\n2. for the brutal attacks on his ex, 34.  \\n3. ………….  \\n4. Top judges today dramatically ruled against the Hollywood actor as the appeal has  \\n5. \"no real prospect of success\"  Markel Marishta  et.al. Johnny Depp and amber heard: how language and societal influences shape power and \\ndiscourses  \\n \\n                                      International Journal of Research and Review (ijrrjournal.com)   138 \\nVolume 11; Issue: 2; February 2024  (Article, The Sun, lines 1 -2, 6-7). \\nThis extract begins with characterizing Johnny Depp as a “ Wife-beater ” before announcing his \\nname. It can be seen that from the beginning, the language used constructs Johnny Depp as \\nbeing a violent man towards Amber Heard, who  is a woman, already formulating the positions \\nof the ex -couple in their relationship. The term “ Wife-beater ”, is one of the multiple terms that \\nare up to a point “common”, meaning that these terms have been used frequently to describe \\nand input individual men who show aggressive behaviors towards women, in a type of group \\nwithin a society, as it can be derived by some of the articles mentioned in the introduction, \\nwhich refer to women having the majority of the public’s spotlight regarding domestic abuse \\ntowards them, where when referring to having the man as the victim and not the perpetrator, a \\nlack of interes t and attention can be seen  \\n(Bhatasara, Chevo & Changadeya, 2013; Hynes et al., 2015; Khan & Arendse, 2021 Pitman, \\n2017) , therefore constructing the discourse of the man being the perpetrator and woman being \\nthe victim as a logical and common factor. This places Johnny Depp, the man, as a subject of \\nhigher access to power in regard to the woman, Amber Heard, and also, it co nstructs a more \\nPatriarchal view in regards to the description of the actors’ relationship dynamic (Hollway, \\n1984 ). Later in the extract, the author briefly mentions both actors’ age, which aims to place \\nagain Johnny Depp as a subject of higher power within their relationship, as in having an age \\ndifference of 23 years. Within the context of a westernized society in 2021, this can be seen as \\n“abnormal” and from a historical context, this type of norm exists in either “eastern” societies \\nor in the past where in both cases the man was the one that held the power within a relationship \\n(Hollway, 1984) . The last part of the extract enforces the discursive power of the man being \\nthe perpetrator and the woman the victim as “common”, as it states that top judges around \\nAmber Heard’s domestic abuse claims against the actor ruled over the actor’s appeal by s tating \\nthat it would have “ no real prospect of success” , showing the subject position of Johnny Depp \\nin this Discourse as already guilty, without being given an opportunity to deny it.  \\nExtract 2  \\n1. The last -ditch attempt by Depp saw old claims Ms Heard was a \"gold  \\n2. digger\" - dismissed by the High Court previously - dragged back up in  \\n3. another character assassination.  \\n4. His lawyer Andrew Caldecott QC said the claim was a \"calculated and  \\n5. manipulative lie\", which gave Ms Heard \"a considerable boost to her  \\n6. credibility as a person\".  \\n(The Sun, lines, 46 -51) \\nThis extract refers to a Discourse that was brought up by Johnny Depp, to which he claimed in \\nthe past that Amber Heard was a “gold digger”. This discourse refers to women essentially \\ntaking advantage of a man’s economic status, by creating a relationship with them, in order to \\nobtain their economical state for themselves afterwards. This creates Amber Heard’s subject \\nposition as a perpetrator against Johnny Depp (Willig, 2008), regarding himself as a victim, \\nwhich relates to the norm of women taking advant age of men, as Johnny Depp is considered a \\nglobally successful actor, placing him in a higher sociocultural hierarchical status in \\ncomparison to Amber Heard. The later claims of Johnny Depp’s previous lawyer that “ the \\nclaim was a calculated and manipulative lie” brings to light possibly a socially acceptable \\nconstruct. Firstly, that the discourse of a woman being a “gold -digger”, can be said to “mirror” \\nthe sociocultural effects of being an abusive man, since in the extract the claims of Amber \\nHeard being a “gold -digger” were said to be calculated and manipulative, meaning that since, \\naccording to the extract, Johnny Depp’s claims could be calculated, a pre -existing discourse of \\ndifferential equality between genders and abusive claims could be evident, when compari ng \\nthose two. Further empowering this discourse, it was said that since these claims were denied, \\nAmber Heard’s “credibility” as a person was “boosted”, which by this statement, the inner Markel Marishta  et.al.

Social constructionism, being the \\nmain theoretical foundation behind FDA analysis, explains how reality can and is subjective, \\nwith language being a powerful tool that helps create soc ietal norms, structures and therefore \\ntruths (Khan & MacEachen, 2021) . The court environment heavily relies on language, as it \\nbases the exploration of truth in the context of the accusers and defenders saying, as well as \\nevidence and fundamentally, in order for a truth to be accepted, most of the times the jury \\nmakes the f inal decision, meaning that the participants in a law case are shifting their focus \\nonto constructing a subject position for themselves that a jury environment would support.  \\nExtract 3  \\n1. Johnny Depp:… she brought up the situation of the - her - f-f-f-fecal matter on the - \\n2. bed, and - I.- hahah, umm and she tried to blame it on the dogs  \\n(Live court defamation lawsuit derived from YouTube)  \\nBefore engaging in the part of the analysis, some context will be provided that was not input \\nin an extract in order to better understand and explain the analysis. Before this testimony from \\nJohnny Depp, as it was later found as evidence, Johnny Depp did n ot want this information to \\nbe public, in sake of their privacy (cited by live court defamation lawsuit derived from \\nYouTube). Moving to the analysis, the actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, in spite of the \\ndifferent power dynamics that exist between the t wo considering their relationship, it can be \\nsaid that due the context of a court environment taking place, their subject position’s powers \\nare mainly controlled by other subjects within the discourse (Willig, 2008) of the court such as \\nlawyers, jury, the judge and in this particular case, the greater percentage of the world, since \\nthis lawsuit is being broadcasted live on YouTube. Johnny Depp’s subject position in that \\nmatter has been constructed as relaxed, playful and truthful. This can be explained by t he third \\nextract, in which Johnny Depp shares private information about Amber Heard about the fecal \\nmatter that she produced on their bed. While firstly it can be seen that the actor takes long \\npauses, and hesitates in sharing this story, reflecting on wha t it was mentioned before that he \\ndid not want to engage in this information exposure, he was later found laughing as he was \\ntelling it and even ridicule it as he later said that Amber “tried to blame it on the dogs” . As it \\nwas mentioned before that subject positions and power within the discourse of the court are the \\nmain vital factors for the pursuit of truth, Johnny Depp uses language in order to construct a \\nsubjective truth about Amber Heard, that based on her con structed behaviour, she acts against \\nunwritten societal rules and accepted norms of both the people attending the court and outside \\nof it (Willig, 2008), since it is being broadcasted. This, in an attempt to diminish the subject \\nposition of Amber Heard, th e constant shift of power dynamics can be observed, and also an \\nevident factor of how language is used to construct a perception of the world, or in this case a \\nperception of a subject position within the discourse (Khan & MacEachen, 2021; Willig, 2008) .  \\nExtract 4  \\n1.

Johnny Depp: (inaudible)…sh -she was always angry yes…..  \\n(Live court Defamation lawsuit derived from YouTube)  \\nThis extract, in the same nature as the previous one, uses language as a way to construct a \\ndifferent subject position regarding Johnny Depp. While the text messages that were not \\nmentioned in this extract, referred to explicit conversations in the company  of the actor’s friend \\nabout a woman, the last text is the one that the analysis is going to be based on, as it constructs \\nthe actor’s subject position upon a toxic masculinity discourse (Hollway, 1984) , in which the \\nman can get and will get the thing he wants, hindering possible acts of enforcement or violence. \\nThis refers to the developmental and biological discourse that since the man has biological \\nadvantages when it comes to physical power, and thro ugh developmental and historical \\ncontexts that the man was the hunter/provider in regard to the woman which is the \\nnurturer/caregiver, that the man has and should have the control (Hollway, 1984) . This is \\nfollowed by Amber’s lawyers attempts to paint  the subject position of Amber being angry at \\nJohnny as logical and therefore constructing a character that does satisfy the norm that exists \\nwithin the 2020s westernized cultural context. Lastly, an attempt by the actor can be seen as \\nregarding the questi on that Amber’s lawyer provided, in order to defend his subject position as \\na quiet and caring character, Johnny mentions that “ she was always angry ”, placing him in the \\nrole of the victim, showing resistance to the toxic masculinity discourse, and furthermore \\nconstructing a counter -discourse in which the perpetrator is the woman, while the victim is the \\nman (Willig, 2008). This counter -discourse, whi le it can be argued to exist already in the \\nmodern westernized societies of the 2010s, the influence of having a major public lawsuit \\ninvolving two globally public figures heavily influences the structures of both the dominant \\ndiscourse which can be consid ered the patriarchal discourse (Hollway, 1984)  and its’ counter -\\ndiscourse respectively.  \\nExtract 5  \\n1.

The \\nrecording that was shown  before the beginning of this extract involved both actors having a \\nconversation with each other about resolving their differences in private, considering their \\ndomestic abuse claims that were already public. Johnny Depp’s lawyer begins questioning the \\nactor in a way that constructs the characterization of victimhood for the actor. The lawyer \\nmentioned firstly the injuries that the actor suffered, and also that they were caused by Amber \\nHeard. This reinforces the previously mentioned counter -discourse of ge nder abuse that was \\nanalyzed, referring to the victim as being the man, which resists the power of the dominant \\ndiscourse of the man being the perpetrator (Hollway, 1984) . Language as it has been mentioned \\nnumerous times throughout this analysis is one of the most vital factors regarding the court’s \\ndiscourse processes, and the way that language, both verbal and non -verbal language is used Markel Marishta  et.al.

This can also be derived by the last question of Johnny Depp’s \\nlawyer, to which she quoted Amber in saying what is your answer t o “tell them Johnny, tell \\nthem that I, Johnny Depp, a Man, I’m a victim of domestic abuse”,  to which he responded yes. \\nThe lawyer constructed a subject position for Johnny Depp, that not only Amber, but the norm \\nthat exists, would think a man posing as a domestic abuse victim would be irregular and \\nirrational. These communication tools, using bo th language and verbal cues, constructed an \\naccepted discourse within the court environment that the man being the victim was not \\nirrational, but a successfully constructed truth.  \\n \\nPublic media and movements regarding public individuals.  \\nThe last theme aims to explain and analyze the way public media outlets and movements were \\ninfluenced by two public individuals, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. This theme focuses on \\nthe conceptualization of cultural contexts. Historical and cultural structures are presented in \\nthis theme by analyzing how societies evolve, change throughout time and the processes that \\ntake place in order to make that change, which in this essay it revolves around the case of \\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard. Social structures such as the MeToo movement and the \\nfeminism movement will be discussed.  \\nExtract 6  \\n1. Johnny Depp: … We write a letter together –  \\n2. Amber Heard: ok  \\n3.

Johnny Depp initiates this idea, by con structing a discourse \\ninvolving public media, that in quote “the media has created such a FUCKING hateful storm \\n– that is sickening” . This discourse portrays how the public media attempts to blame and \\nexaggerate the individual’s conflicts, placing the subject positions of Johnny and Amber as two \\nsubjects were anything that they do and say, can seem as either guilty and punishable, crea ting Markel Marishta  et.al.

As reality, is considered \\nto be created by the use of language and laws around a society, the l anguage used by the \\nculture’s “participants”, can be considered to mirror a collective construct of acceptance, \\nmeaning that the factor that decides what is acceptable and what is not in a societal and \\nhistorical context is its’ people. That can also be vi ewed by the claims of Amber Heard as she \\nstates that her credibility has been ruined, further empowering the hierarchical status of the \\nmedia being above her, while also mentioning that the nature of the career of both parties being \\nactors, thus public fig ures, their subject positions regarding their career and society depend on \\nthe public’s normative laws.  \\nThe last two lines of this extract show a constant motif that emerges throughout this analysis. \\nWhile Johnny Depp tries to construct a position of victimhood within their relationship, by \\nsaying that she lost him his finger, Amber tries to deconstruct his subjective role by quoting \\n“you could say it was a fair fight ”. A constant discourse surrounding Johnny Depp revolves \\naround a more modern cultural structure that men are not getting enough attention on matters \\nsuch as domestic abuse (Khan & Arendse, 2021). While on the other hand, Amber Heard is \\nresisting this disc ourse by empowering her position within a more historical discourse \\n(Hollway, 1984) , in which the fact that she cannot deny her involvement in her ex’s husband \\ninjury with his finger, she tries to construct a reality in which this was acceptable, by saying \\nthat this was a fair fight, were if taking into consideration her subject position  throughout the \\ntrial, Amber was placed in a more developmental discourse herself, with beliefs that since the \\nman developmentally is physically more enhanced (Hollway, 1984) ), this would not be \\nconsidered a fair fight, thus inclining more on her attempting to deconstruct Johnny’s discourse, \\nrather than resolve their problems.  \\nExtract 7  \\n1. “I spoke up against sexual violence – and faced our culture’s wrath.”  \\n2. ….. \\n3. This trial has turned into a public orgy of misogyny. While most of the vitriol in  \\n4. nominally directed at Heard, it is hard to shake the feeling that really, it is directed  \\n5. at all women – and in particular, at those of us who spoke out about gendered abuse  \\n6. and sexual violence during the height of the #MeToo movement.

One woman has been made into a symbol of a movement that many view with fear  \\n10. and hatred, and she’s being punished for that movement  \\n(The guardian, The Amber Heard – Johnny Depp trial was an orgy of misogyny, lines, 8 -9, 59 -\\n64) \\nThis extract engages on a different point of view, referring to how the conflict between Johnny \\nDepp and Amber Heard has affected two different westernized cultured constructions. The first \\nline refers to what Amber Heard mentioned in her article on The Su n, which directly brings to \\nlight the feminism discourse. The language used in the first line constructs the normative reality \\nof how women are treated when they speak out about their sexual abuse experiences. By the \\nline “ faced our culture’s wrath” , an indication of an existent hierarchical status can be \\nobserved, where women are objectified, and mistreated by the culture’s standards in regards to \\nthemes as sexuality and abuse (Hollway, 1984) , co-existing with the historical discourse of \\ntoxic masculinity and patriarchy, in which women’s status in the wider societal context, \\nconsidering their position in society, are often seen as below their counterpart’s position. The \\nauthor of this article further engages in this statement, claiming that the trial between the actor’s \\nreflected how women all across the world are treated. As Amber Heard is a public figure which \\nsupports the MeToo movement, the author constructed a link between the MeToo moveme nt Markel Marishta  et.al. Johnny Depp and amber heard: how language and societal influences shape power and \\ndiscourses  \\n \\n                                      International Journal of Research and Review (ijrrjournal.com)   143 \\nVolume 11; Issue: 2; February 2024  and the loss of Amber Heard’s trial appearance as a “predictable” outcome, where women who \\nspeak out about abuse claims are more often than not shut down, claiming that the society has \\nconstructed an anti -feminist discourse, countering therefore the femini st act which originated \\nin the 70s (Hollway, 1984) . This statement refers to women being powerless, re -constructing \\nthe patriarchal discourse that, as it was analyzed before, Johnny Depp attempted to resist, \\nplacing men higher in the society’s hierarchy as normative, and placing Amber Heard and \\nwomen as a  group going against it, and attempting to change it.  \\n \\nDISCUSSION  \\nIn the part of the analysis, three major themes surrounding the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard \\ndomestic abuse case were analyzed. The first one being the gender differences that were \\nconstructed between the two parties. The second theme focused on the context  of the trial  \\nenvironment and how laws and language are constructed differently within this context. The \\nlast theme focused on social constructions such as the MeToo movement and the feminism act \\nand how these were indirectly affected by the interplay of power between Johnny Depp and \\nAmber Heard.  \\nFurthermore, the first theme reflects on two basic modern gender sexualization discourses. The \\npatriarchal discourse reflects on how men, from a historical context of showing aggressive \\nbehaviors and a subject position of them being considered as hunters (Hollway, 1984) , it \\nconstructs the position of men being sexually violent and abusive towards women as a logical \\nconclusion in domestic abuse cases, which can correlate with the studies of (Hynes et al., 2015  \\n; Pitman, 2017), which the participants, as well as the researchers exhibited behaviors of \\ninclining in ideologies of the Man being the perpetrator as normative. This can be further \\nobserved by the claims the author made in the article The Sun and the UK’ s legal system, in \\nwhich Johnny Depp was targeted as an abusive husband to Amber Heard, without given a \\nchance to decline these accusations in a court environment, while also having a major \\ninformation -sharing structure in UK such as The Sun, to further em power the position of \\nJohnny Depp being the abuser, as he was subjected to. The second extract, contradictory to the \\nfirst one, brought forth a discourse which places women as taking advantage of men’s societal \\nand economical status for their benefit by cr eating the term gold -digger (Hollway, 1984) ). This \\ncan be seen as a counter -discourse to the previously mentioned one, as the operations behind \\nthis discourse rely on how claims of men being abusive are considered fake constructions that \\nwomen make in order to firstly diminish their societal status  and obtain their economic status \\nfor themselves. This discourse aims to shift the power that men who are participating in the \\npatriarchal discourse have, in order for them to obtain the role of the victim rather than the \\nperpetrator.  \\nThe second theme revolves around language and laws within court. Social constructionism \\nrefers to terms that often are considered as mainly biological and immutable, such as gender, \\nas socially constructed and fluid, with individual’s perceptions and langu age usage being the \\nfundamental tools that are used in constructing subjective realities (Young & Colin, 2004). \\nConsidering the theory of social constructionism, the defamation trial regarding Johnny Depp \\nand Amber Heard involved a significant number of ho w power relations between them shifted \\nwith the usage of language and presented evidence, which unless the court dismisses, they can \\nbe considered as truths. The court discourse takes into consideration multiple roles that take \\npart in establishing a decis ion, ranging from jury, judge, lawyers and in this case public opinion. \\nBased on this statement, power relations and constructions of subject positions of both Johnny \\nDepp and Amber Heard were observed, as relating to the third extract that was analyzed, \\nJohnny Depp shared a private story involving the ex -couple, where Amber defecated in their \\nbed, accompanied with a slight laughter. This constructed the role of Johnny as being truthful \\nand likable , while subjecting Amber’s role with accompanied feelings of disgust, a discourse Markel Marishta  et.al. Johnny Depp and amber heard: how language and societal influences shape power and \\ndiscourses  \\n \\n                                      International Journal of Research and Review (ijrrjournal.com)   144 \\nVolume 11; Issue: 2; February 2024  in which Johnny is favored both by the jury, and the public media. This was followed by Amber \\nHeard’s team of revealing explicit texts, in which Johnny Depp showed behaviors such as \\nsexual violence and force ( “I NEED. I WANT. I TAKE.” ), which like before, aimed to change \\nthe subject position of Johnny Depp being a likable  and honest character, and construct a \\ndifferent role for the actor as being capable of distributing abusive and “anti -feminist” \\nbehaviors (Donegan, 2022). These instances exhibited a constant pattern that was noticeable \\nthroughout the trial, where the foc us did not rely only on telling the truth, but how the jury, the \\njudge and the public eye would construct their subjective truths regarding the actors (Khan & \\nMacEachen, 2021), thus emerging the pattern of constantly constructing and deconstructing \\nJohnny’ s and Amber’s subject positions in court, where ultimately Johnny, by stating that he \\nwas indeed a victim of domestic abuse, both empowered his subject position as truthful and \\nlikable , and also went against the discourse that was mentioned in the first theme, of men being \\nthe perpetrators as being common.  \\nThe third and final theme refers to the influence that the conflict between the two actors had in \\nregard to the wider societal context outside the courtroom , as well as how the public media \\ninfluenced the relationship between the two actors, where specifically two major movements \\nwere brought up, the MeToo movement, and the feminism act. In the sixth extract, Johnny \\ndescribed how the media took a persecutory role in their life, as Johnny claimed to have \\nexaggerated the significance of their claims. This can be said to show some of the processes \\nthat define the wider cultural discourse around domestic abuse, while possibly dividing culture \\ninto two different gr oups. The ones that go against Johnny Depp, therefore supporting  the \\nPatriarchal discourse, and the ones that go against Amber Heard, supporting the exploiting \\ndiscourse, in which women take advantage of men. An example of this possible division can \\nbe seen in the last extract, in which the author is against Johnny Dep p’s victory, marking it as \\na clear resemblance to what happens when women stand up to domestic abuse (Donegan, \\n2022). Considering the fact that Amber Heard is part of the MeToo movement, and a public \\nfigure also, this loss, based on the author, resembled n ot only the actor, but the position of all \\nwomen in society, claiming that society operates within anti -feministic laws, therefore \\nconstructing a discourse around women not having the same opportunities and rights as men \\nhave (Donegan, 2022). This claim go es against a study that was mentioned in the introduction, \\nin which the researchers (Khan & Arendse, 2021) claimed that contradictory to women’s abuse \\ncases, men do not often get the appropriate recognition and attention needed, as them being the \\nvictims w hile women are the perpetrators.  \\n \\nCONCLUSION  \\nIn conclusion, a key factor that was evident throughout the essay is the concept of fluidity \\nregarding gender. As Foucauldian Discourse Analysis mentions, laws, norms and truths are \\nsocial constructs, and not based only on biological and developmental fact ors, but rather than \\nsociocultural concepts within specific contexts. Foucault’s concept of power was a constant \\ntheme that surrounded the case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, with power being either \\nused as a tool of creation of discourses, resisting disc ourses or altering certain subject positions \\nwithin the discourses, while also, the use of language, especially in the court environment, was \\nin many instances observed to be a tool of constructing subjective realities, hindering concepts \\nof both power and  language as the fundamental tools that are used in constructing the social \\nworld. Future directions involving this study could focus on either other discourses or cultures \\nthat this study did not include, such as taking into consideration eastern cultures  and their \\nhistorical contexts.  \\n \\nDeclaration by Authors  \\nAcknowledgement: None  Markel Marishta  et.al.
